# 🐢 TrolltheTerminal

Welcome, brave terminal warrior!  
Your mission, should you choose to accept it: **Find the flag** before your brain melts.

---

## 🚀 How to Start

Enter the world of sigmaflagtickler

⏳ Time Limit
You have 30 minutes to troll the terminal, confuse the filesystem, and sniff out that juicy flag.
Tick-tock, hacker. ⏰

🛠️ Allowed Commands
Only these commands are your weapons today:

cd — teleport between folders (or get lost)

ls — spy on what's hiding around you

ls -a — same as ls but with creepy invisible stuff too

mkdir — build secret lairs

touch — create empty whispers

cat — read the ancient scrolls

echo — whisper secrets to files or the void

Hint: These commands might do what they say... or maybe they don't.
Also, sometimes ls -a shows things even ls is too shy to reveal.

💡 Pro Tips (or Trolls)
cd .. is your best friend when you want to escape that weird folder you accidentally entered.

Sometimes folders are empty, but not really.

Files might look innocent but hide dark secrets inside.

Create files with touch, but beware: empty files might be the key... or just empty.

echo can write stuff... or troll you back.

⚠️ Warning
No fancy commands like rm, mv, or sudo here. Play safe, or you might break reality (and the challenge).
Also, keep an eye out for suspiciously named files... or suspiciously suspicious folders.

🎉 Good luck!
May your fingers be fast and your brain not fried.
The flag is waiting... somewhere.
