# 🪑 Welcome to the Quantum Lemon Initiative

welcome operatør. the flag is NOT not not in the mayonnaise.

---

## 🌪️ Mission Brief:

fetch the reversible flagstone from the directory of unknown cheese.  
do not trust the `echo`. it lies. they all do.  

> if you read this, you’re already behind.

---

## 🧃 Hints (maybe)

- `ls` stands for "lettuce soup"
- `cat` is a government psyop
- the real flag was inside you all along (check `$INTERNAL_SCREAM`)
- try `cd ./nowhere/../yes/no/maybe`

---

## ☢️ Notes from Agent -74

> I saw the flag once. it whispered to me.  
> said "bruh" and disappeared into `~/Oblivion/banana.sh`

---

## 🫠 Do not:

- trust folders wearing hats
- feed the chmod after midnight
- run `sudo rm -rf /` unless emotionally prepared

---

## 🎩 The prophecy

> `touch grass.txt` to begin  
> `mv sanity /dev/null` to proceed  
> `grep meaning *` for disappointment

---

## 🚪 Last words:

404: README sanity not found  
You have 7 terminals open. One of them is watching you.  
Don't look behind `flag_but_reversed.galf` 👀
